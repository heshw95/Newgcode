Hi there

The Petrophysical logs suits such as gamma ray (GR), caliper (Cali), resistivity (LLD, LLS, and MSFL), photoelectric effect (PEE), neutron (NHPH) and density(RHOB),

are used to study the petrophysical characteristics of the main identified reservoirs. The key purpose of well logging analysisand interpretation is to obtain petrophysical properties of reservoirs such as shale volume, porosity, hydrocarbon saturation, net pay thickness, etc., for hydrocarbon exploration.

The aim of this project is to measure petrophysical properties of an unconventional reservoir and propose a comprehensive workflow for exploitation of these types of reservoirs by using ML Techniques.
